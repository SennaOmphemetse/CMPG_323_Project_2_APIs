# ACCESSABILITY
Administrators use the application's authentication and authorization information security procedures to protect both systems and data. These will aid in controlling the system's accessibility. There would be two sections: one for the stakeholders (admin) and one for the users.

## Stakeholders
When stakeholders access the application for the first time, they must register in the admin registration form. There are fields that must be filled out, and if the admin misses any of them, the application will indicate that one is missing. When the admin register, their email address will be used to log in and will not be used to register again. The admin can log in and manage the system after registering.

To log in, the administrator must enter their email address and password. 

## Users(client)
The user must also fill out the register-user form. All of the fields must be completed before the registration can be completed. As a result, the user can log in. If the username is already in the database, the application will prompt the user to create a new username. Because it will be used to log in, the username must be unique.
